# Github App
## By Alexandru Miculescu

This is the POC for the Github app.

There are a lot of improvements that can be done to this app. For example:

- [ ] Persist the data
- [ ] Paginate the get repo request
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add app icons
- [ ] Imporve the UI

But this is just an app that demonstrates some coding skills and styles so I have kept the functionality to a minimum.
